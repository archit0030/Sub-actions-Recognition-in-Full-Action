# Video Capture and Gemini API Integration

This project captures a video, uploads it to the Gemini API, and generates a sequence of subtasks based on the video content. The generated subtasks are designed for a robotic manipulator to operate upon.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or above
- OpenCV
- Google Generative AI Client Library
- IPython (for Jupyter Notebook integration)
- Time

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/archit0030/Sub-actions-Recognition-in-Full-Action.git
   cd your-repo-name

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python google-generativeai ipython

## Usage

1. Capture and Save Video:
   The script captures video from a default webcam or a specified video file and saves it to 'pro.mp4'.
2. Configure and Use Gemini API:
   Upload the captured video and generate a sequence of subtasks using the Gemini API
3. Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with the actual Gemini API key.
